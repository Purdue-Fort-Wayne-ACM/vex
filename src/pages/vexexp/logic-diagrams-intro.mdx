# What is a Logic Diagram? 
A logic diagram is another tool programmers can use to break down the flow of logic in their programs and plan out their projects. We may
provide you logic diagrams, alongside a way to interpret them, such as a table outlining what certain shapes or icons mean. There are different
standards for logic diagrams in programming and engineering, which try to use similar shaping and structure; however, this is not a perfect
system. 

If making a logic-diagram of your own, the important things to note are the shapes for:
 - Program entry
 - Conditional-points 
 - Loops
 - Functions

<br/ >
This will allow you to plan out the control flow throughout your program. Consider this program diagram:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Program Start] --> B(Get Menu Choice)
    B --> |User Input| C{if User Input...}
    C -->|phone| D[Phone fa:fa-phone]
    C -->|house| E[House fa:fa-house]
    C -->|car| F[Car fa:fa-car]
    C --> J(Print error message)
```

<br/ >
We might implement this program like this:

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`user_choice = input("Which menu do you want?")

if user_choice == "phone":
    Phone() # Call phone function
elif user_choice == "house":
    House() # Call house function
elif user_choice == "car":
    Car() # Call car function
else:
    print("Please enter one of the following options: car, phone, or house.")
    `}
    tooltips={tooltipConfig}
    theme="dark"
    showLineNumbers={true}
    copyButton={true}
    className="mb-6"
/>


We implemented something to collect the menu choice and print the error message, and we used an if-statement on the User's input just like the
diagram outlined. However, more serious programs make this more beneficial. Consider this diagram:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c026a2f-bb5c-423d-80f7-8908a6ada576 "Diagram determining if a Discord user should be sent a notification")


It's a lot even with the diagram, but it'd be worse if it were just code - even if it were simplified psuedocode. One would typically use a
diagram to outline the overall functionality of a program (specifically the decisions we make throughout the program) and then use psuedocode
to plan out the specific details.
