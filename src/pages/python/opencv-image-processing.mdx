## Introduction to OpenCV and Image Basics <a id="intro"></a>

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful tool for working with images and videos. Think of it as a toolkit that helps
computers "see" and understand images the same way humans do. When we look at a photo, we automatically recognize faces, objects, and colors.
OpenCV gives us the tools to teach computers to do the same thing pretty easily.

The image we will work with for this tutorial is provided [here](/images/pfw_logo+test.png).

### What is a Digital Image?

A digital image is essentially a grid of tiny colored dots called pixels. Each pixel has a specific color value. For example, a black and
white image might have pixels with values from 0 (completely black) to 255 (completely white), or a pure binary representation of 0 (for completely black) or 1 (for completely white). 
Color images typically use three channels - Red, Green,and Blue (RGB) - with each channel having values from 0 to 255. The way that these intensities combine in the human 
eye's perception is what produces the illusion of a distinct color (and why smaller pixels tend to improve quality up to a point).

#### Why represent images like this?
There are alternative ways to represent images such as representing their components using signals, or representing the information they convey & rasterizing an image from that 
(ie vector images). These representations have benefits, such as being better for compression, easier to transmit, lossless in quality/scale, or fitting well with other 
similar data! 

However, we choose to use pixels because they are tractable and intuitive. If you represent an image's components as a signal, you heighten the required math and understanding 
needed to work with the image alongside making altering individual image pieces more difficult. If you represent an image in an alternative format and convert it into pixels 
whenever you wish to display it, you incur a performance cost. 

Pixels are discrete and defined units of information. You know the range of their values, and often know all the dimensions (width, height, channels), and thus you know the image size and possible 
combinations. You can speak of individual pixels or individual pixel components entirely separately from their neighboring channels or pixels. Pixels also have a somewhat 
implicit representation as an array or matrix, which makes performing math on them straightforward with computers (and matrix operations). This is a representation with 
tradeoffs - images using pixels are lossy, they don't rotate well without interpolation, and they don't always implicitly lend themselves to advanced compression insights - 
but in the real world these are often insignificant relative to the benefits. 


#### Why use OpenCV? A story, and an explanation
We use OpenCV when we want to make decisions based on image data. 

Let's imagine a scenario where we own many orange trees because they're pretty, and our friend
makes a bet with us - they bet they have more oranges on their trees. Both you and your friend have many many orange trees, and neither of you have the time to count 
oranges, but you must win this bet! If only there was a way you could count every orange on every tree reliably - a way that could work on both of your beautiful yards.

You sit in a stupor, mind spinning for a solution, until you recall something from an ACM meeting! You can make decisions based on the data stored within images. 
Luckily for you, you have a high resolution camera and both you and your neighbor have photogenic yards. You recall something you can do, known as color detection. 
By detecting orange spots within an image, you can detect oranges in the trees! This works brilliantly - until it doesn't. You quickly realize that detecting a single
color within the images counts *some* oranges, but it *only* counts *some* oranges. Oranges in the shadow or sun have a different color! 

Luckily you paid attention, and you remember that it's possible to detect colors within a certain *distance* of another color! And so you modify your program to detect 
every shade of orange near your chosen shade, and you manage to detect all of the oranges!! However your neighbor is quick to point out that you have orange stones
while they have blueish stones. You chekc your output, and surely enough it's counting parts of your house! 

You ask a peer for help, and they suggest you check the shape and area of the shapes you detect - and finally you have a solution! You win the bet!

    },

      src: '/images/oranges_over_thresh.png', 
      comment: 'A Threshold image with overdetection' 
    }]} />

    <br />

Of course, these skills generalize beyond detecting oranges in hobby projects (though that's a great place to start!). 
Image processing can be used on the production line, in the sciences and medicines for detection or correction, in the arts for cool processing effects and edits,
in machine learning for recognition or prediction (faces, weather, etc) - really anywhere we can see or make images we can use image processing. OpenCV provides a toolkit 
to do this! So let's get into it. 

<WarningCard>

</WarningCard>
<br />

Let's start with a simple example that loads and displays an image:

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2

# Load the image
image = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg')  # Replace with your image file path

# Check if the image was loaded successfully
if image is None:
    print("Failed to load image.")
else:
    # Display the image
    cv2.imshow('Image', image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
 `}
    tooltips={opencvGUIBasicsTooltips}
    theme="dark"
    showLineNumbers={true}
    copyButton={true}
    className="mb-6"
/>
Let's walk through the program briefly

The image `your_image.jpg` (or whatever path you provide) will be returned in array form by `cv2.imread`. We store this in a variable. 

We check that this variable isn't undefined (meaning we successfully got an image).

And we produce a popup with the title `Image`, displaying the image stored in the variable `image`. 

If we're willing to use Tkinter, we can add some basic UI functionality! 

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2
from tkinter import Tk, filedialog

# Hide the root Tk window
Tk().withdraw()

# Open file dialog
file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename()

# Load and display image
image = cv2.imread(file_path)
if image is not None:
    cv2.imshow('Selected Image', image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
else:
    print("Failed to load image.")`}
    tooltips={opencvGUIBasicsTooltips}
    theme="dark"
    showLineNumbers={true}
    copyButton={true}
    className="mb-6"
/>

Or for a more advanced example, we can start to work with some of the image properties OpenCV provides:

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import numpy as np

def select_and_display_image():
    # Create a simple file dialog to select an image
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.withdraw()  # Hide the main window
    
    # Ask user to select an image file
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
        title="Select an Image",
        filetypes=[("Image files", "*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.bmp *.tiff")]
    )
    
    if file_path:
        # Load the image
        image = cv2.imread(file_path)
        
        # Display basic information about the image
        height, width = image.shape[:2]
        print(f"Image size: {width} x {height} pixels")
        print(f"Image shape: {image.shape}")
        
        # Display the image
        cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
        cv2.waitKey(0)  # Wait for any key press
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    
    root.destroy()

# Run the function
select_and_display_image()
    `}
    tooltips={opencvGUIBasicsTooltips}
    theme="dark"
    showLineNumbers={true}
    copyButton={true}
    className="mb-6"
/>

Output:
<Terminal>
Image size: 206 x 245 pixels
Image shape: (245, 206, 3)
</Terminal>
<br />

Image output:
![image](/images/pfw_opencv.png "Image output of the Purdue Fort Wayne Logo")

This script demonstrates the basic workflow: select a file, load it with OpenCV, and display it. The `cv2.imread()` function loads the image
into memory as a numpy array, which is essentially a big grid of numbers representing pixel values.

<NoteCard>
**Numpy Arrays**
Numpy Arrays are essentially the same as C-style arrays, but with specific higher level operations provided. In the case of an image, the dimensionality 
will generally be a H x W x D or - [H][W][D] array - where *H* represents the image height, *W* represents the image width, and *D* represents the channel count 
or depth. So an RGBA (rgb with 'alpha' or transparency, like PNG) image with a height of 200 pixels and a width of 40 pixels would be represented by an array like `image[200][40][4]`.
</NoteCard>

We store this array (Python list) into a variable, and check its first two dimensions - which provides us the Height and Width. We do this using a list comprehension,
 the `image.shape[:2]` operation. `image.shape` (or the `.shape` property of any numpy image object) will return a tuple/list of the form `(height, width, channels)`. 
 The `[:2]` operation reads the first two array values starting from the left. 

## Image Math: Averages, Blur, and Unsharp <a id="image-math"></a>

### Understanding Image Averaging

Image averaging is like taking the average score of a test - you add up all the values and divide by how many there are. In images, we often
average pixel values with their neighbors to create different effects.

When we average neighboring pixels, we get a smoother, less detailed image. This is the foundation of many image processing techniques.

### Blur: Smoothing Out the Details

Blurring is like looking at something through frosted glass - the basic shapes are there, but the fine details are softened. Mathematically,
we replace each pixel with the average of itself and its neighbors.

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import numpy as np

def blur_image_example():
    # Select image file
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.withdraw()
    
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
        title="Select an Image to Blur",
        filetypes=[("Image files", "*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.bmp *.tiff")]
    )
    
    if file_path:
        # Load the image
        original = cv2.imread(file_path)
        
        # Apply different types of blur
        # Simple average blur - replaces each pixel with average of surrounding pixels
        simple_blur = cv2.blur(original, (15, 15))  # 15x15 kernel size
        
        # Gaussian blur - gives more weight to closer pixels (more natural looking)
        gaussian_blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(original, (15, 15), 0)
        
        # Display results
        cv2.imshow('Original', original)
        cv2.imshow('Simple Blur', simple_blur)
        cv2.imshow('Gaussian Blur', gaussian_blur)
        
        print("Press any key to close windows")
        cv2.waitKey(0)
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    
    root.destroy()

blur_image_example()`}
    tooltips={opencvGUIBasicsTooltips}
    theme="dark"
    showLineNumbers={true}
    copyButton={true}
    className="mb-6"
/>

![image](/images/pfw_gaussianblur.png "Gaussian blur on the Purdue Fort Wayne logo")

### Unsharp Masking: Making Images Crisper

Unsharp masking sounds backwards - we use blurring to make images sharper! Here's how it works: we subtract a blurred version from the
original image to find the edges and details, then add those back to the original image to make it appear sharper.

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import numpy as np

def unsharp_mask_example():
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.withdraw()
    
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
        title="Select an Image to Sharpen",
        filetypes=[("Image files", "*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.bmp *.tiff")]
    )
    
    if file_path:
        original = cv2.imread(file_path)
        
        # Step 1: Create a blurred version
        blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(original, (9, 9), 10.0)
        
        # Step 2: Find the difference (this highlights edges and details)
        unsharp_mask = cv2.addWeighted(original, 1.5, blurred, -0.5, 0)
        
        # Display results
        cv2.imshow('Original', original)
        cv2.imshow('Blurred Version', blurred)
        cv2.imshow('Unsharp Masked (Sharpened)', unsharp_mask)
        
        print("Notice how the sharpened image has more defined edges!")
        cv2.waitKey(0)
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    
    root.destroy()

## Resizing Images <a id="resizing"></a>

Resizing images is like stretching or shrinking a rubber sheet. When we make an image larger, we need to create new pixels (interpolation).
When we make it smaller, we need to decide which pixels to keep or combine.

### Important Considerations

1. **Aspect Ratio**: The width-to-height ratio of your image. If you don't maintain this ratio, your image will look stretched or squished.

2. **Quality Loss**: Making an image larger than its original size will always result in some quality loss because we're creating information
that wasn't originally there.

3. **Interpolation Methods**: Different mathematical methods for creating new pixel values when resizing.

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import numpy as np

def resize_image_example():
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.withdraw()
    
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
        title="Select an Image to Resize",
        filetypes=[("Image files", "*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.bmp *.tiff")]
    )
    
    if file_path:
        original = cv2.imread(file_path)
        height, width = original.shape[:2]
        
        print(f"Original size: {width} x {height}")
        
        # Method 1: Resize by specific dimensions (might change aspect ratio)
        resized_fixed = cv2.resize(original, (400, 300))
        
        # Method 2: Resize by percentage (maintains aspect ratio)
        scale_percent = 50  # 50% of original size
        new_width = int(width * scale_percent / 100)
        new_height = int(height * scale_percent / 100)
        resized_percent = cv2.resize(original, (new_width, new_height))
        
        # Method 3: Resize maintaining aspect ratio to fit within bounds
        max_width, max_height = 600, 400
        scale = min(max_width/width, max_height/height)
        new_width = int(width * scale)
        new_height = int(height * scale)
        resized_fitted = cv2.resize(original, (new_width, new_height))
        
        # Display results
        cv2.imshow('Original', original)
        cv2.imshow('Fixed Size (400x300)', resized_fixed)
        cv2.imshow('50% Scale', resized_percent)
        cv2.imshow('Fitted to 600x400', resized_fitted)
        
        print("Compare the different resizing methods!")
        cv2.waitKey(0)
        cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    
    root.destroy()

## Color Channel Alterations <a id="channel-alts"></a>

Color images are made up of three separate channels: Red, Green, and Blue. Each channel is like a separate black and white image that
represents how much of that color is present at each pixel. When combined, these three channels create the full-color image we see.

### Understanding Color Channels

Think of it like having three colored flashlights (red, green, blue) shining on a white wall. Where all three overlap, you get white light.
Where only red and green overlap, you get yellow. This is how digital color works!

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import numpy as np

def color_channel_example():
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.withdraw()
    
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
        title="Select a Color Image",
        filetypes=[("Image files", "*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.bmp *.tiff")]
    )
    
    if file_path:
        # Load image (OpenCV loads as BGR, not RGB!)
        original = cv2.imread(file_path)
        
        # Split into individual color channels
        blue_channel, green_channel, red_channel = cv2.split(original)
        
        # Create colored versions of each channel for better visualization
        # Make empty arrays for the other channels (filled with zeros)
        zeros = np.zeros(blue_channel.shape[:2], dtype="uint8")
        
        # Create colored channel images
        blue_colored = cv2.merge([blue_channel, zeros, zeros])
        green_colored = cv2.merge([zeros, green_channel, zeros])
        red_colored = cv2.merge([zeros, zeros, red_channel])
        
        # Convert to grayscale (different methods)
        gray_average = cv2.cvtColor(original, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        gray_weighted = cv2.cvtColor(original, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        
        # Display results
        cv2.imshow('Original', original)
        cv2.imshow('Blue Channel', blue_colored)
        cv2.imshow('Green Channel', green_colored)
        cv2.imshow('Red Channel', red_colored)
        cv2.imshow('Grayscale', gray_average)
        
        print("Notice how different objects appear brighter in different color channels!")

### Converting Between Color Spaces

Sometimes it's useful to work in different color spaces. HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) is often easier for detecting specific colors because it
separates color information from brightness.

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog

def color_space_conversion():
    root = tk.Tk()

        title="Select an Image for Color Space Conversion",
        filetypes=[("Image files", "*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.bmp *.tiff")]
    )
    
    if file_path:
        original = cv2.imread(file_path)
        
        # Convert to different color spaces

        lab_image = cv2.cvtColor(original, cv2.COLOR_BGR2LAB)
        
        # Split HSV channels
        hue, saturation, value = cv2.split(hsv_image)
        
        # Display results
        cv2.imshow('Original (BGR)', original)
        cv2.imshow('HSV Version', hsv_image)
        cv2.imshow('Hue Channel', hue)
        cv2.imshow('Saturation Channel', saturation)
        cv2.imshow('Value/Brightness Channel', value)

## Thresholding <a id="thresholding"></a>

Thresholding is like sorting things into two groups: "light enough" and "too dark" (or vice versa). It's a simple way to grayscale images
into binary (black and white) images.

Imagine you're looking at a page of text. Your eyes automatically separate the dark text from the light background. Thresholding does the same
thing - it picks a brightness level and says "anything brighter than this becomes white, anything darker becomes black."

### Basic Thresholding

    )
    
    if file_path:
        original = cv2.imread(file_path)
        
        # Convert to grayscale first (thresholding works on grayscale)
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(original, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        
        # Apply different threshold values
        # Anything below threshold becomes 0 (black), above becomes 255 (white)
        _, thresh1 = cv2.threshold(gray, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
        _, thresh2 = cv2.threshold(gray, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

### Adaptive Thresholding

Sometimes a single threshold value doesn't work well for the entire image. For example, if part of your image is in shadow and part is in
bright light, you need different thresholds for different areas. Adaptive thresholding automatically adjusts the threshold based on the local
neighborhood of each pixel.

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import numpy as np

def adaptive_thresholding():
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.withdraw()
    
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
        title="Select an Image for Adaptive Thresholding",
        filetypes=[("Image files", "*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.bmp *.tiff")]
    )
    
    if file_path:
        original = cv2.imread(file_path)
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(original, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        
        # Global thresholding (same threshold for entire image)
        _, global_thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
        
        # Adaptive thresholding - threshold changes based on local area
        adaptive_mean = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(gray, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C,
                                            cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
        
        adaptive_gaussian = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(gray, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C,

## Image Denoising <a id="denoise"></a>

Image noise is like static on an old TV - random variations in pixel values that don't represent the actual image content. Noise can come from
camera sensors, compression, or transmission errors. Denoising is the process of removing this unwanted noise while preserving the important
details of the image.

### Understanding Noise

Digital noise appears as random speckles or grain in your image. It's especially visible in photos taken in low light conditions or with high
ISO settings. The challenge with denoising is removing the noise without also removing important details like edges and textures.

<PythonScriptRenderer
    code={`import cv2
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
import numpy as np

def image_denoising():
    root = tk.Tk()
    root.withdraw()
    
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
        title="Select a Noisy Image",
        filetypes=[("Image files", "*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.bmp *.tiff")]
    )
    
    if file_path:
        original = cv2.imread(file_path)
        
        # Apply different denoising methods
        
        # Method 1: Simple Gaussian blur (removes noise but also blurs details)
        gaussian_denoised = cv2.GaussianBlur(original, (5, 5), 0)
        
        # Method 2: Non-local means denoising (color image)
        # This method is smarter - it looks for similar patches in the image
        nlm_denoised = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored(original, None, 10, 10, 7, 21)
        
        # Method 3: Bilateral filter (preserves edges while reducing noise)
        bilateral_denoised = cv2.bilateralFilter(original, 9, 75, 75)
        
        # For grayscale images, we can also try:
        gray = cv2.cvtColor(original, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        gray_denoised = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoising(gray, None, 10, 7, 21)
        
        # Display results
        cv2.imshow('Original', original)
        cv2.imshow('Gaussian Blur', gaussian_denoised)
        cv2.imshow('Non-Local Means', nlm_denoised)
        cv2.imshow('Bilateral Filter', bilateral_denoised)
        cv2.imshow('Grayscale Denoised', gray_denoised)
        
        print("Compare the different denoising methods!")
        print("Non-local means preserves details better but takes longer to compute.")

### Adding Noise for Testing

Sometimes it's helpful to add controlled noise to an image so you can test your denoising algorithms:

from tkinter import filedialog
import numpy as np

def add_noise_and_denoise():
    root = tk.Tk()

        title="Select a Clean Image to Add Noise",
        filetypes=[("Image files", "*.jpg *.jpeg *.png *.bmp *.tiff")]
    )
    
    if file_path:
        original = cv2.imread(file_path)
        
        # Add Gaussian noise
        noise = np.random.normal(0, 25, original.shape).astype(np.uint8)
        noisy_image = cv2.add(original, noise)
        
        # Add salt and pepper noise
        salt_pepper = original.copy()
        # Add salt (white) noise
        salt_coords = np.random.randint(0, original.shape[0], int(0.005 * original.size))
        pepper_coords = np.random.randint(0, original.shape[1], int(0.005 * original.size))
        salt_pepper[salt_coords[0:len(salt_coords)//2], pepper_coords[0:len(pepper_coords)//2]] = 255
        salt_pepper[salt_coords[len(salt_coords)//2:], pepper_coords[len(pepper_coords)//2:]] = 0
        
        # Denoise the noisy images
        denoised_gaussian = cv2.fastNlMeansDenoisingColored(noisy_image, None, 10, 10, 7, 21)
        denoised_salt_pepper = cv2.medianBlur(salt_pepper, 5)  # Median filter works well for salt & pepper
        
        # Display results
        cv2.imshow('Original Clean', original)
        cv2.imshow('With Gaussian Noise', noisy_image)
        cv2.imshow('Denoised Gaussian', denoised_gaussian)
        cv2.imshow('With Salt & Pepper Noise', salt_pepper)

## Putting It All Together <a id="all-together"></a>

## Summary <a id="summary"></a>

These are a few of the things you should feel semi comfortable with:
1. **Images are just arrays of numbers** - understanding this is key to everything else
2. **Blurring smooths details** - useful for noise reduction and creating artistic effects
3. **Sharpening enhances edges** - the unsharp mask technique is counterintuitive but powerful
4. **Resizing requires careful consideration** - maintain aspect ratios and understand quality trade-offs
5. **Color channels can be manipulated separately** - this opens up many creative possibilities
6. **Thresholding separates regions** - essential for many computer vision tasks
7. **Denoising removes unwanted artifacts** - different methods work better for different types of noise

<br/ >
These techniques form the foundation for more advanced image processing and computer vision applications. Practice with different images and
parameter values to build your intuition for how these operations affect different types of images.
